        <h4>Here are the ingredients for Paprika Fried Eggs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs - However many you want</li>
            <li>Oil - Vegetable, Olive, Avocado, Sesame or Peanut. Butter works too.</li>
            <li>Paprika - Hence the name</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper - To use as additional seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h4>Here are the steps to prepare </h4>
        <ol>
            
            <li>
                This technique is perhaps unconventional, but it's how I 
                ensure that the paprika flavor penetrates the egg white and 
                egg yolk as much as possible. And when you keep your yolk runny, 
                you can still dip your toast in it without feeling the need to add more salt â€” 
                the flavor is already there.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Instead of cracking the egg into the pan and then seasoning it with salt and pepper,
                start by blooming the salt, pepper, and paprika in the pan and then add the egg.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                (As always, remember to heat your stainless steel pans before adding oil.)
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The hot oil helps intensify the flavor of the paprika, 
                which will fizz a little and become fragrant and dark red very quickly. 
                By blooming the spices first, when the egg settles into the pan, 
                the oil is already packed with flavor that cooks right into the egg.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once you crack the egg into the pan, all it needs is one 
                last teeny-tiny pinch ofsalt and a grind of pepper over the 
                yolk before it firms up to seal the yolk between two layers of flavor.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Letting the egg it cook low and slow gives the yolk and the egg white time 
                to absorb the flavors in the pan without overcooking it. 
                A teaspoon of water added to the pan before you cover it creates steam, 
                which helps the surface of the egg cook more evenly.
            </li>

        </ol>
